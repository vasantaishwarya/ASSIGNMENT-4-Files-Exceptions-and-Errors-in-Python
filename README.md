File Handling Project

This repository contains two Python programs demonstrating basic file handling operations:

 1. read_file
- Opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt`.
- Prints its contents line by line.
- Gracefully handles the error if the file does not exist, informing the user.

How to run:
Make sure `sample.txt` exists in the same directory, then run or
If `sample.txt` does not exist, the program will display an appropriate error message.


2. write_append_file

Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.

Appends additional predefined data to the same file.

Reads and displays the final content of the file.
